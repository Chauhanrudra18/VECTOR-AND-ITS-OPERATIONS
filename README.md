# VECTOR-AND-ITS-OPERATIONS
***************************************************************************Project Description****************************************************************************************

This project demonstrates various operations that can be performed on vectors in C++. It provides a theoretical understanding of vectors along with practical implementations of common vector operations, making it useful for students and competitive programmers.

Table of Contents

1. Theory OF VECTOR:
 ->VECTOR ARE STL SEQUENCE CONTAINERS WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO STORE DATA WITHOUT GIVING ALLOCATING MEMORY TO IT.
 ->BY USING DIFFERENT METHODS YOU CAN PERFORM OPERTAIONS ON VECTORS.
 ->YOU CAN FIND VECTOR DIFFERENT METHODS ON "c++reference" link="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector".
 ->USING VECTORS AND ALGORITHMS IN C++ MAKE YOU DO COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING MAKE YOU DIFFERENT FROM OTHER USERS OR COMPETITERS.
 ->HOPE YOU LEARN AND ENJOY THIS PROJECT.
 ->IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER NEW OPERATIONS OF VECTORS YOU CAN GIVE ME A PULL REQUEST I WILL MERGE YOUR BRANCH.

################Support Information###################

->If you have any additional vector operations, feel free to make a pull request to enhance this project.

4.Project Roadmap

->Understand the basics of vectors.

->Refer to C++ STL documentation for more vector operations.

->Implement and optimize different vector operations.


5.Project Status

âœ… Completed

6.Contribution Guidelines

->If you want to contribute, you can modify the variable names in the vector declaration.

Example: Change vector<int> v; -> vector<int> your_name;.

Ensure proper coding standards and documentation.


7.Conclusion
